# Neural-Networks
An implementation of the LVQ and K-means algorithm.

This project was developed for the Neural Networks course at the Computer Science and engineering dept of University of Ioannina.

# LVQ
LVQ can be understood as a special case of an artificial neural network, more precisely, it applies a winner-take-all Hebbian learning-based approach. It is a precursor to self-organizing maps (SOM) and related to neural gas, and to the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (k-NN).

# K-means
Given a set of observations (x1, x2, …, xn), where each observation is a d-dimensional real vector, k-means clustering aims to partition the n observations into k (≤ n) sets S = {S1, S2, …, Sk} so as to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) (sum of distance functions of each point in the cluster to the K center).

# Compile
If you are compiling on the command-line with the gcc command, you would accomplish this by putting -lm at the end of the command.
